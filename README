fedora-gather-easyfix
=====================


The idea of this program is to gather tickets from different project
which are marked as 'easyfix' (or any other keyword for that matter).

The script retrieve the list of participating project from:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pingou/easyfix (this should change
at some point) and generates a HTML page in the directory where it's
run.
It should probably be integrated within a cron job to be made
accessible.

In order for a trac to be added there are some requirements:
- Enable the XMLRPC plugin via the plugin page of the trac admin
  interface
  You will need to enable:
   - all the    tracrpc.ticket.*
   - the entry  tracrpc.xml_rpc.*
- Add XML_RPC to the anonymous user in the permission page of the
  admin interface
